# 2. Development Environment Set-up

Follow the steps below to get a server running locally after cloning the repository.

## 2.1. Backend

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

2. Install requirements from the [backend](./backend) sub-directory.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install PostgreSQL on your local machine.

4. Create a new `.env` file from `.env.example`. The steps to retrieve the GitLab related tokens have been outlined in
   the project set-up
   guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_-YJlWVVLTFPRGOcYA9XfxT4XPXqUUmfSMDdoHLOM9c/edit?usp=sharing). Here
   is a list of the basic changes required:
    - `DATABASE_USER`
    - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
    - `DATABASE_NAME`
    - `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` _This is retrieved from GitLab. You can make use of either an individual access token or a
      project access token._
    - `GITLAB_PIPELINE_TRIGGER_TOKEN` _This is retrieved from GitLab._

4. Instantiate a database

```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
psql postgres
CREATE ROLE your_username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name OWNER your_username;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_username;
```

```
psql -U postgres -d your_database
ALTER ROLE username SUPERUSER;
```

5. Run migrations with alembic from the [root folder](./backend/) to update the database.

```
alembic upgrade head
```

6. Start server by running [main.py](./backend/app/main.py) from within `/backend`.

```
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

7. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to view the server endpoints and documentation.

## 2.2. Frontend

1. To get started on the frontend, we'll need to install the respective dependencies.

```
npm i
```

2. Run the following command to get the Next.js app started.

```
npm run dev
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the server homepage.

## 2.3. GitLab

To conduct and test integration with GitLab from our local servers, we need to expose our local server through a proxy.
We can make use of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for this.

1. Run the server locally as per steps outlined above.

2. Open a separate terminal and expose the server through the ngrok proxy.

```
brew install ngrok
ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

3. Change respective links `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the target repository.

4. Pushing new commits to the target repository should trigger a API calls to our local servers through the ngrok proxy.

# 3. Testing

As the focus of the project is a backend pipeline, we make use of unit tests on the backend to garner confidence in the
behaviour of the product. Run the `pytest` command from the [root backend directory](backend/) to begin testing the test
suite.

_[Back to top](#gitlab-vulnerability-detection-pipeline)_

<!-- ### Load Tests
We conduct load tests with [locust](https://locust.io/). All load testing files can be found in `backend/tests/load`.

To run the load tests, navigate to `/backend` and run `locust -f tests/load`. Click the generated link and use the GUI to configure your desired tests. -->

# 4. Building with Docker-compose

> Note: Docker files have been configured in order to accommodate observability. This was done initially to help us
> determine the performance of our servers during initial load tests. This have since not been maintained and used. The
> documentation outlined below demonstrates how it has been used previously and should still be relevant since the
> compose
> files are mainly configurations and nothing has been changed with regards to the database environment variables.

---

After changing relevant `.env` variables in step 4 of
the [Development Environment Set-up](#2-development-environment-set-up), runing the docker-compose scripts will either
build or rebuild the server and database, running all migrations.

```
docker compose up

# or

docker-compose up --build
```

> Note: to remove volumes during a compose shutdown, run `docker-compose down --volumes`. Required if you run into an
> error stating volumes have already been initialised.

# 5. GitLab Scripts

A separate README.md file has been written [here](backend/scripts/gitlab/README.md) to guide developers on how they can
make use of GitLab's Ruby validation scripts.
