# GitLab Scripts
This folder contains helpers from GitLab. There is no need to install Ruby or run the validators in production. These scripts are here to assist during development.

# Set-up
Before using the `validate.rb` script. You will first need to install ruby.

> You can do so on MacOS with `brew install rbenv ruby-build` to install the Ruby version manager [(`rbenv`)](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

# Usage
You should be able to run the `validate.rb` script after installing a valid Ruby version.

```
ruby validate.rb sast-report-format_15-0-7.json gl-sast-report_21-05-23.json
```

On our server frontend, accessing a specific job allows you to directly download the artefact we send to GitLab. This allows you to make use of this Ruby script to directly compare if the schema is conformant to GitLab's requirements.
